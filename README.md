# THINC

A Java client for THINC. THINC is a virtual display architecture for Thin-Client Computing.

Thinc is a virtual display architecture for high performance thin client computing. A thin client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate with each other over a network using a remote display protocol. The protocol is used to send graphical updates to the client over the network. The client simply sends user input to the server and the server interprets and executes those commands, sends the screen updates to the client, which the client subsequently interprets and displays to the user. 

- Supports full desktop interaction.
- Full support for audio as well as video playback. 
- Resizing of the client window as well. 

This was my project during my masters degree at Columbia. This code is just for archiving purposes and is not maintained. Use at your own peril.
